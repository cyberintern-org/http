Designed to be fully compliant with the HTTP specification, its focus is set on simplicity, scalability, and resilience. Alongside the HTTP library, this repository contains an implementation of a HTTP server, httpd. 

This work is part of the Cybernetic Internationale initiative, which aims to create a free, decentralized, and secure software ecosystem.
